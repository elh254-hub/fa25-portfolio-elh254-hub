## About Me 
 
Hello! My name is Emma Harshberger, and I am studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University with a technical interest in engineering design, turbomachinery, and high-performance sports equipment. I am especially fascinated by how material science and mechanical systems influence athletic performance and product innovation.

My coursework has strengthened my interest in topics such as thermodynamics, solid mechanics, and materials engineering. Recently, I’ve been exploring how principles of solid mechanics and materials translate into industries ranging from medical prosthetics to engineered equipment in competitive athletics.

In May 2026, I will begin a Mechanical Engineering Co-Op with Rawlings Sporting Goods, where I will be contributing to engineering development and performance research in professional-grade sports equipment through December 2026. As a long-time softball athlete, this opportunity uniquely blends my athletic background with my engineering goals.

Outside academics, I am a member of the Cornell Softball Team. Competing at the Division-I level has not only shaped my discipline and teamwork, but also inspired my interest in the mechanical behavior, material properties, and design optimization behind elite sports technology.

My engineering areas of interest include: 
- Mechanical design
- Solids mechanics and materials
- Thermodynamics

Looking ahead, I hope to contribute to advanced equipment design, athletic engineering, propulsion systems, or energy-based mechanical innovation where engineering design directly influences performance and new product development.
